# Climate Forecast Skill Assessment Repository
This repository is dedicated to the assessment of climate forecast skill of multi-model ensembles, such as the Heidke Skill Score (HSS). 
The HSS is a metric used to evaluate the accuracy of categorical forecasts, making it particularly relevant for assessing the performance of climate models in predicting categorical outcomes.

## Features
Multi-Model Ensemble Evaluation: Evaluate the skill of climate forecasts by considering the predictions from multiple models and for multiple initializations.

Heidke Skill Score Calculation: Implement the computation of Heidke Skill Scores to quantitatively assess the accuracy of categorical forecasts.

Spatial Analysis: Perform spatial analyses to assess forecast skills across different regions.

## Scripts
Scripts have .Rmd extension, so make sure to change .R file into .Rmd for better readability and flawless execution.
